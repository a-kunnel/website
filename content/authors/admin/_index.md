Hi! My name is Aline. I am currently a PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics, at The University of Adelaide. My research focuses on using a geometrical hypercube structure for data with a large number of predictors and small number of samples, particularly gene expression data.

I am enthusiastic about a few things- my love for ggplot in R, statistics and empowering diversity in STEM- particularly Maths!

I am a member of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS) and Statistical Society of Australia (SSA). I am currently the Mathematics Officer for the Women in STEM Society (WISTEMS) at The University of Adelaide. I was the former Vice President (2020) and Publicity Officer (2019). 

In my spare time, I enjoy graphic design & baking (and eating) sweet treats!
